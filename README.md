# Airbnb-Clone-Project

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. The goal is to create a functional web application where users can search property listings, view detailed information, and complete bookings. This project will include frontend and backend development, UI/UX design, database integration, and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (optional)
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Design**: Figma
- **Deployment**: Netlify / Vercel (Frontend), Render / Heroku (Backend)

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Create intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features

- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary Pages

| Page                  | Description                                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with filters                       |

| Simple Checkout View  | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation                            |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A well-designed booking system reduces friction, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, responsive design, and accessible layouts are essential.

## Figma Design Specifications

### Color Styles

- **Primary**: #FF5A5F
- **Secondary**: #008489
- **Background**: #FFFFFF
- **Text**: #222222
- **Secondary Text**: #717171

### Typography

- **Primary Font**: Circular
- **Headings**: Bold (700), 24pxâ€“32px
- **Body Text**: Medium (500), 16px
- **Secondary Text**: Book (400), 14px

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Understanding mockup design properties ensures consistency between design and development. Identifying color styles and typography from Figma helps translate visual designs into functional components accurately.

# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project backend is built to simulate a real-world booking platform. It focuses on user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. This project is designed using modern backend technologies with a focus on scalability, security, and API-first development.

## Team Roles
### Backend Developer	
Build RESTful and GraphQL APIs, implement business logic, and handle authentication/authorization.
### Database Administrator	
Design, manage, and optimize the PostgreSQL database schema and indexing strategies.
### DevOps Engineer	
Set up Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, and ensure smooth deployments.
Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams
Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery
### QA Engineer
Test endpoints, automate test cases, and ensure system reliability.
Makes sure an application performs according to requirements
Spots functional and non-functional defects

## Technology Stack
Django:	Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
Django REST Framework (DRF):	Simplifies API creation and management.
GraphQL:	Provides flexible and efficient data querying.
PostgreSQL	Relational database used for storing structured data.
Celery:	Handles background tasks like sending emails or payment processing.
Redis:	Caching and session management to boost performance.
Docker:	Ensures consistent development environments across systems.
GitHub Actions:	Automates tests and deployments (CI/CD).

## Database Design
### User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

### Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/

## Feature Breakdown
**User Management**: Allows users to register, log in, and manage profiles securely.
**Property Management**: Hosts can list, update, and delete their rental properties.
**Booking System**: Enables guests to reserve properties with check-in/out details.

**Review System**: Users can leave reviews and rate their stays.
**Optimized Performance**: Indexing and caching boost speed and reduce server load.

## API Security
### Key Security Measures:
**Authentication**: Token-based (JWT) login for users.
**Authorization**: Ensures users only access their resources (e.g., bookings).
**Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute-force and abuse of endpoints.
**Input Validation**: Protects against SQL injection and XSS.
**Secure Payments**: Sensitive data is handled securely via HTTPS and payment gateway encryption.

## Importance
Protects user data and personal information.
Prevents unauthorized access and tampering.
Ensures financial transactions are secure.

## CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) automates testing and deployment of code, improving reliability and development speed.
### Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates tests on pull requests and pushes.
Docker: Ensures the app runs in consistent environments across dev and prod.
Docker Compose: For managing multi-container services like Django, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
